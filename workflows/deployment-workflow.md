# Deployment Workflow Guide

*This guide provides structured deployment workflows ensuring safe, reliable releases using the Context Engineering Framework.*

## 🚀 Deployment Philosophy

### Progressive Deployment Strategy
```
Development → Staging → Production
    ↓           ↓          ↓
  Daily      On-demand   Scheduled
  
Rollback capability at each stage
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Readiness
```
@memory-bank/TASK-TRACKER.md @memory-bank/TEST-FRAMEWORK.md @memory-bank/DEFECTS.md

Pre-deployment verification:
- [ ] All planned tasks complete
- [ ] All tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Code coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] No critical/high defects
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

### Environment Readiness
```
Environment checklist:
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Infrastructure scaled appropriately
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Communication plan ready
```

## 🔄 Deployment Pipeline

### Stage 1: Development Deployment

#### Automatic Deployment
```yaml
Trigger: Push to develop branch
Steps:
  1. Run unit tests
  2. Build application
  3. Deploy to dev environment
  4. Run smoke tests
  5. Notify team
```

#### Validation
```
Dev deployment validation:
- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Basic functionality works
- [ ] No errors in logs
```

### Stage 2: Staging Deployment

#### Pre-Staging Checks
```
@memory-bank/ARCHITECTURE.md @memory-bank/TEST-FRAMEWORK.md

Staging readiness:
1. Verify feature complete
2. Check integration points
3. Confirm test coverage
4. Review performance metrics
5. Validate security controls
```

#### Staging Deployment Process
```bash
# 1. Create release candidate
git tag -a v1.2.0-rc1 -m "Release candidate 1"

# 2. Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# 3. Run full test suite
npm run test:staging

# 4. Performance testing
npm run test:performance

# 5. Security scanning
npm run security:scan
```

#### Staging Validation Checklist
```
Staging validation (24-48 hours):
- [ ] All features working as expected
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] E2E tests passing
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] User acceptance testing complete
```

### Stage 3: Production Deployment

#### Pre-Production Review
```
Final review meeting agenda:
1. Feature demonstration
2. Test results review
3. Performance analysis
4. Security assessment
5. Rollback plan review
6. Go/No-go decision
```

#### Production Deployment Steps

##### Step 1: Preparation
```bash
# Create backup
npm run backup:production

# Verify rollback capability
npm run test:rollback

# Notify stakeholders
npm run notify:deployment-start
```

##### Step 2: Deployment Execution
```bash
# Blue-Green Deployment
1. Deploy to green environment
2. Run health checks
3. Run smoke tests
4. Switch traffic gradually (canary)
5. Monitor metrics
6. Complete traffic switch
7. Keep blue environment for rollback
```

##### Step 3: Post-Deployment
```bash
# Immediate validation (0-15 min)
- Health checks passing
- Key metrics normal
- No error spike
- Performance stable

# Extended monitoring (1-24 hours)
- User activity normal
- No increase in errors
- Performance consistent
- Business metrics healthy
```

## 🔍 Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment
```
Current (Blue) → New (Green)
       ↓              ↓
   Keep running   Deploy new
       ↓              ↓
   Fallback      Test thoroughly
       ↓              ↓
   Archive      Switch traffic
```

**When to use**: Major releases, database changes

### 2. Canary Deployment
```
Production Traffic Distribution:
- 5% → New version (15 min)
- 25% → New version (1 hour)
- 50% → New version (2 hours)
- 100% → New version (if healthy)
```

**When to use**: Gradual rollout, risk mitigation

### 3. Rolling Deployment
```
Instance Updates:
1. Update instance 1 → Verify → Continue
2. Update instance 2 → Verify → Continue
3. Update instance N → Verify → Complete
```

**When to use**: Zero-downtime requirements

### 4. Feature Flag Deployment
```javascript
if (featureFlag.isEnabled('newFeature')) {
  // New implementation
} else {
  // Existing implementation
}
```

**When to use**: Decouple deployment from release

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
```
Rollback if:
- [ ] Error rate > 5% (vs baseline)
- [ ] Response time > 2x baseline
- [ ] Health checks failing
- [ ] Memory usage > 90%
- [ ] CPU usage > 80% sustained
```

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# 1. Confirm rollback decision
npm run rollback:confirm

# 2. Switch traffic to previous version
npm run traffic:switch-to-previous

# 3. Verify stability
npm run health:check

# 4. Investigate issues
npm run logs:analyze --time="last-hour"

# 5. Document incident
npm run incident:create
```

### Rollback Validation
```
Post-rollback checks:
- [ ] Previous version running
- [ ] All services healthy
- [ ] Performance normal
- [ ] No data corruption
- [ ] Users can access system
```

## 📊 Deployment Monitoring

### Real-Time Metrics
```
Dashboard monitoring:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Deployment Status: IN PROGRESS  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Progress: ████████░░ 80%        │
│ Health: ✅ All systems normal   │
│ Errors: 0.02% (baseline: 0.01%) │
│ Response: 145ms (target: <200ms)│
│ Traffic: 1,234 req/s           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Metrics to Track
```yaml
Application Metrics:
  - Response time (p50, p95, p99)
  - Error rate
  - Request rate
  - Active users

Infrastructure Metrics:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk I/O
  - Network throughput

Business Metrics:
  - Conversion rate
  - Transaction volume
  - User engagement
  - Revenue impact
```

## 🔐 Security Deployment Considerations

### Security Checklist
```
Pre-deployment security:
- [ ] Secrets rotated
- [ ] SSL certificates valid
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Dependencies updated
- [ ] Vulnerability scan clean
- [ ] Access controls verified
```

### Sensitive Deployments
```
For security-critical updates:
1. Deploy during low-traffic window
2. Extra monitoring period
3. Security team on standby
4. Incident response ready
5. Communication plan active
```

      - tags
    when: manual
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://app.example.com
```

### Deployment Scripts
```bash
# scripts/deploy.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Starting deployment..."

# Pre-deployment
./scripts/pre-deploy-checks.sh

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy-application.sh

# Post-deployment
./scripts/post-deploy-validation.sh

echo "Deployment complete!"
```

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

### Post-Deployment Review
```
After each deployment:
1. What went well?
2. What took longer than expected?
3. Were there any surprises?
4. How can we improve?
5. Update deployment procedures
```

### Metrics to Track
```
Deployment efficiency:
- Lead time: Code to production
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to recovery
- Change failure rate
- Deployment duration
```

## 🚑 Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Deployment
```
Critical production issue:

1. Create hotfix branch
2. Implement minimal fix
3. Fast-track testing
4. Deploy to staging (5 min test)
5. Deploy to production
6. Monitor intensively
7. Full test suite after
```

### Disaster Recovery
```
Major failure:

1. Activate incident response
2. Assess impact
3. Execute rollback if needed
4. Restore from backup if required
5. Communicate status
6. Post-mortem analysis
```
