## Task Execution Protocol

### Before Starting Any Task
1. Read current task description
2. Review relevant PRD section
3. Check architecture constraints
4. Verify no blocking defects

### During Task Execution
1. Follow TDD approach (write tests first)
2. Implement solution
3. Run tests locally
4. Update documentation as needed

### After Completing a Task
1. Mark task as complete: `[x]`
2. Run all relevant tests
3. Check for new defects
4. Update implementation status
5. Commit changes with descriptive message
6. Request user approval to continue

### Quality Gates
- **Sub-task Level**: Tests pass, code reviewed
- **Parent Task Level**: Full test suite, no critical defects
- **Phase Level**: Stakeholder review, all defects resolved

## AI Execution Guidelines

### Context Management
- Always read this file at session start
- Update task status immediately upon completion
- Reference specific sections of PRD/Architecture
- Keep implementation status current

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests before implementation
- Ensure 80% code coverage minimum
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Run regression tests after changes

### Communication Protocol
- Request explicit permission between tasks
- Report any blockers immediately
- Provide progress updates at phase boundaries
- Highlight any deviations from plan
