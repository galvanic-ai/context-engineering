# Context Engineering Framework

A comprehensive framework for managing context, tasks, and quality in AI-assisted software development projects using Claude Code.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Context Engineering Framework provides:
- **Structured documentation templates** for maintaining project context
- **Task management systems** for systematic development
- **Testing frameworks** ensuring quality at every step
- **Workflow guides** for consistent execution
- **Prompting patterns** optimized for Claude Code

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Framework
```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone <repository-url> context-engineering
cd context-engineering

# Copy templates to your project
cp -r context-templates memory-bank workflows prompting your-project/
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project
```bash
# Create your memory bank
cd your-project
mkdir memory-bank

# Copy essential templates
cp context-templates/prd-template.md memory-bank/PRD.md
cp context-templates/architecture-template.md memory-bank/ARCHITECTURE.md
cp context-templates/task-tracker-template.md memory-bank/TASK-TRACKER.md
cp context-templates/test-framework-template.md memory-bank/TEST-FRAMEWORK.md
cp context-templates/defect-tracking-template.md memory-bank/DEFECTS.md
```

### 3. Start with Claude Code
```
@memory-bank/PRD.md
Help me create a PRD for [your project description].
Let's define the requirements comprehensively.

## 🔄 Core Workflow

### 1. **Define** → Create PRD
Define what you're building with comprehensive requirements.

### 2. **Design** → Architecture Document
Design how you'll build it with technical specifications.

### 3. **Plan** → Generate Tasks
Break down the work into manageable, testable tasks.

### 4. **Execute** → Development Workflow
Build systematically with continuous testing and validation.

### 5. **Validate** → Testing & User Acceptance
Ensure quality through comprehensive testing and user feedback.

### 6. **Deploy** → Controlled Release
Deploy safely with monitoring and rollback capabilities.

### 7. **Maintain** → Living Documentation
Keep all documentation current as the project evolves.

## 📚 Key Components

### 1. Memory Bank System
Your project's persistent context storage:
- **PRD.md** - Living requirements document
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical decisions and status
- **TASK-TRACKER.md** - Current progress and tasks
- **TEST-FRAMEWORK.md** - Testing strategy and results
- **DEFECTS.md** - Issue tracking and resolution

### 2. Template Library
Comprehensive templates for:
- Product requirements with implementation tracking
- Architecture with component status dashboards
- Task management with phase-based execution
- Test planning with coverage requirements
- Defect tracking with severity management

### 3. Workflow Guides
Step-by-step procedures for:
- Development execution with TDD
- Testing at all levels (unit, integration, E2E)
- Safe deployment practices
- Context management with AI

### 4. Prompting Patterns
Optimized patterns for:
- Session initialization
- Task execution
- Context switching
- Progress tracking
- Quality validation

## 🎓 Getting Started Guide

### Step 1: Project Setup
1. Copy framework to your project
2. Initialize memory bank with templates
3. Create initial PRD with Claude Code
4. Design architecture based on requirements
5. Generate task list from PRD

### Step 2: Development Cycle
1. Start session with context loading
2. Select next task from tracker
3. Write tests first (TDD)
4. Implement solution
5. Validate with tests
6. Update documentation
7. Get user approval

### Step 3: Quality Assurance
1. Maintain 80% test coverage
2. Track all defects systematically
3. Run regression tests regularly
4. Performance test critical paths
5. Security scan before deployment

### Step 4: Deployment
1. Complete deployment checklist
2. Deploy to staging first
3. Validate thoroughly
4. Deploy to production with monitoring
5. Be ready to rollback if needed
